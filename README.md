Highlights of the Project

• React’s ability to use state to re-render the page instantly allowed for a faster and better user
experience compared to server-side rendering

• Page data and images are populated by pulling data from the RoboHash and “JSON placeholder” open source API's, which saved development time by eliminating the need for a backend server

• Deployed to production on Github Pages because it is a great solution for static sites, especially demos

• Redux made state management easier, predictable and also helps with debugging & testing



Technology used: React, Tachyons, redux, redux-logger and Git
